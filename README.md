# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample ERC20 token contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Usage:

```shell
# compile contract
npx hardhat compile

# run tests
npx hardhat test

# run local node

npx hardhat node

# deploy token contract

npx hardhat deploy_token --network <network>
```
